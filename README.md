This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose equality (==) and null checks.  The `bug.js` file contains code with a potential error, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, resulting in incorrect comparisons and potential bugs.  Always prefer strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons, especially when dealing with null or undefined values.
